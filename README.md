# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders game implemented in openGL using GLUT.
This is my take on the classic arcade video game "Space Invaders". This game is written in C and uses OpenGL.

# How to Run

### WINDOWS USERS: 
- Make sure you have GLUT installed
- Copy the contents of the main.cpp file to your code editor or IDE and compile and run it.

### macOS USERS: 
- You must have Xcode Command Line Tools installed. Run this command in the Terminal.

   > xcode-select --install
- Copy the contents of the main_macos.cpp file to your code editor or IDE and save it as 'project.cpp' .
- to compile and run the program run these lines in the Terminal.

   >g++ -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT project.cpp
- Now that the file is compiled, run it using:

   >./a.out
